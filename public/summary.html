          I’m a passionate student with a growing love for web development and technology. Focused, curious, and self-driven, I thrive on building user-friendly digital experiences and learning new tools and concepts. With a deep interest in software engineering, data, and innovation, I’m constantly exploring how tech can solve real-world problems. I balance formal education with hands-on projects and continuous learning, always aiming to grow, contribute, and create impact. Open to collaboration, mentorship, and opportunities that challenge me to become better, one line of code at a time.
